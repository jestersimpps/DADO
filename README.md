# Completely DAO Development.

The idea is to build an application that serves as a tool to support incentivized open source software development with decentralized governance.
I think it is possible to completely decentralize, incentivize and democratize software development. Including all development decision making and steps.


- Github: repository, issues, pull requests
- Gitcoin: incentivizing open source developers
- Aragon: Governance
